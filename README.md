A browser extension that protects buyers from AI-generated product scams on Etsy by analyzing images, seller history, reviews, and pricing patterns.

Includes:
- Extract the image and view if it is using SynthID to check if the picture has been ai generated by Google DeepMind
- Sentiment analysis, using Gemini's API to compare pictures in the reviews' pictures of the product to the product's showcase images in order to determine if the product has used AI to make the product look better than it is
- The ability to see if a product's sale has been duplicated from the original seller, and determine the original seller's product and date posted
